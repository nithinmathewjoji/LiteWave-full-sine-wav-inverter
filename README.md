### **3. Working Principle**

1. **DC Input and Regulation:**  
   The inverter uses a 12V battery as the primary power source. The input voltage is stepped up and regulated to 18V, 12V, and 5V DC for various subsystems.

2. **High-Frequency Switching:**  
   The MOSFET bridge converts the 12V DC into a high-frequency AC signal, which is processed by the HF transformer.  

3. **Voltage Step-Up and Rectification:**  
   The HF transformer steps up the voltage to 380V AC. This is rectified and filtered to produce a stable high-voltage DC.

4. **SPWM Signal Generation:**  
   The EGS002 module generates SPWM signals, which are used to drive the IGBT bridge.

5. **AC Output Conversion:**  
   The IGBT bridge converts the high-voltage DC into a sinusoidal AC output. This is filtered to ensure a clean sine wave.  

6. **Feedback Control:**  
   The voltage feedback system continuously monitors the output and adjusts the SPWM signals for stable operation.

7. **Thermal Management:**  
   The fan control circuit activates the cooling fan when the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, preventing component overheating.
